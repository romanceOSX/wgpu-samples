Creating the texture resource
    queue.write_texture
        -> Texture descriptor
        -> pixel_data 

View and Sampler
    Texture::create_view
    Sampler::create_sampler

Bindings
    Bind group layout
    Bind group

pipeline_layout <===>  bind_group_layout

Rasterization
    rasteize(List<Primitive>, state) -> List<RasterizationPoint> 

    We are given a list of primitives, we give ouw a list of rasterization points
    with the interpolated properties from the primitive

    This stage maps the generated primitives into the 2-dimensional rendering area of the
    framebuffer (Into the attachments in the current render pass)

    The output of this stage is described in terms of 'Rasterization Points' TODO: describe this thang

    Fragment Processing
        This stage produces a fragment for each 'Rasterization Point'

    Framebuffer Coordinates
        Standard Sample Pattern
            These are represented in (x, y) coords, note that a single coordinate, say (0,0)
            retpresents a single point of the pixel 'square', so a single pixel would be represented
            by the following points: {(0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (1, 0)}
            This is known as the 'Standard Sample Pattern'

    Framebuffer Destination
        - position (framebuff coords)
        - sample Index (just an index)

    Rasterization Points
        - fragment destination (which pixel it affects)
        - mask (???)
        - frontFacing (if it is facing front)
        - perspective divisor (the w component in clip space, i.e. 1/w)
        - depth
        - vertices (which vertices does this single pixel contains)
        - barycentric coords (???)

Fragment Processing
    process_fragment(rasterization_point, descriptor, state) -> fragment


Bind groups vs Bind group layouts
    The layouts define the interface, it is used so the pipeline knows beforehand
    the resources it uses for the programmable stages

    The bind groups describe the actual resources which are set at runtime, not at
    pipeline creation
